    Compound (COMP) is an ERC-20 asset that empowers community governance of the
    Compound protocol; COMP token-holders and their delegates debate, propose,
    and vote on all changes to the protocol.


    By placing COMP directly into the hands of users and applications, an
    increasingly large ecosystem will be able to upgrade the protocol, and will
    be incentivized to collectively steward the protocol into the future with
    good governance.


    Each day, approximately 1,234 COMP will be distributed to users of the
    protocol; the distribution is allocated to each market (ETH, USDC, DAIâ€¦),
    and is set through the governance process by COMP token-holders.


    Within each market, half of the distribution is earned by suppliers, and the
    other half by borrowers.


    When you use Compound to supply or borrow assets, you'll automatically begin
    accruing COMP; in the Market Distribution table above, you can see how much
    COMP is distributed by market and activity.


    COMP is only claimable by addresses that directly interact with the protocol
    (msg.sender), and that are capable of calling the claim function.
