    The COMP token allows users to participate in the governance of the Compound
    protocol. COMP token-holders and their delegates debate, propose and vote on
    all changes to the protocol. 


    This system empowers the community to govern the Compound protocol and
    ensures that those who use the protocol have a say in its future. The daily
    distribution of COMP tokens ensures that users are incentivized to
    participate in good governance.


    Each day, approximately 1,234 COMP are distributed to users of the protocol;
    the distribution is allocated to each market (ETH, USDC, DAIâ€¦), and is set
    through the governance process by COMP token-holders.


    Within each market, half of the COMP tokens are earned by suppliers and the
    other half by borrowers. When users use Compound to supply or borrow assets,
    they automatically start accruing COMP. 


    COMP can only be claimed by addresses that interact with the protocol and
    are able to call the claim function.
