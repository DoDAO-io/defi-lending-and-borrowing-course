    Compound is one of the first DeFi platforms in the DeFi space. Like other
    DeFi lending and borrowing platforms, users in Compound can Lend asserts to
    earn interest and can also borrow by having a over collateralized position. 


    Compound recently released their version three of the protocol, also Called
    "Compound III". and it is quite different from V2. Compound III prioritized
    safely and isolation of the assets above everything. In V3 when you supply
    collateral, it remains your property. It can never be withdrawn by other
    users (except during liquidation)


    In the new version of the protocol, there is a separate market for each
    token. That token acts as the "base token" in that market. A supplier can
    lend the base token in the market and can earn interest. When a borrower
    wants to borrow that base token from the market, he can deposit one or more
    of the other tokens listed in the market as collateral. No interest will be
    accrued by these assets that are supplied as collateral.

    The COMP token allows users to participate in the governance of the Compound
    protocol. COMP token-holders and their delegates debate, propose and vote on
    all changes to the protocol. 


    This system empowers the community to govern the Compound protocol and
    ensures that those who use the protocol have a say in its future. The daily
    distribution of COMP tokens ensures that users are incentivized to
    participate in good governance.


    Each day, approximately 1,234 COMP are distributed to users of the protocol;
    the distribution is allocated to each market (ETH, USDC, DAI…), and is set
    through the governance process by COMP token-holders.


    Within each market, half of the COMP tokens are earned by suppliers and the
    other half by borrowers. When users use Compound to supply or borrow assets,
    they automatically start accruing COMP. 


    COMP can only be claimed by addresses that interact with the protocol and
    are able to call the claim function.
