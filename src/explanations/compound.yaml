    ### Introduction


    Compound is one of the first DeFi platforms in the DeFi space. Like other
    DeFi lending and borrowing platforms, users in Compound can Lend asserts to
    earn interest and can also borrow by having a over collateralized position. 


    Compound recently released their version three of the protocol, also Called
    "Compound III". and it is quite different from V2. Compound III prioritized
    safely and isolation of the assets above everything. In V3 when you supply
    collateral, it remains your property. It can never be withdrawn by other
    users (except during liquidation).


    In the new version of the protocol, there is a separate market for each
    token. That token acts as the "base token" in that market. A supplier can
    lend the base token in the market and can earn interest. When a borrower
    wants to borrow that base token from the market, he can deposit one or more
    of the other tokens listed in the market as collateral. No interest will be
    accrued by these assets that are supplied as collateral and cTokens are no
    longer used.


    The major concepts to understand in Compound III are,


    ### Utilization and Interest Rates

    The interest rates for supply and borrowing are based on the utilization
    rate of the base asset. There is a point beyond which the interest rate
    starts to increase more rapidly, called the "kink." Interest accrues every
    second, using the block timestamp. Collateral assets do not earn or pay
    interest.


    This function returns the current protocol utilization of the base asset.
    The formula for producing the utilization is:


    `Utilization = TotalBorrows / TotalSupply`


    ```solidity

    function getUtilization() public view returns (uint)


    // RETURNS: The current protocol utilization percentage as a decimal,
    represented by an unsigned integer, scaled up by 10 ^ 18. E.g. 1e17 or
    100000000000000000 is 10% utilization.

    ```


    ### Supply

    The supply function allows users to add assets to the protocol in order to
    increase their borrowing capacity. This function can be used to add
    collateral, supply the base asset, or repay an open borrow of the base
    asset. Collateral can only be added if the market is below its supplyCap.


    Compound III enables users to earn interest on their positive balances of
    the base asset, based on separate interest rate models that are set by
    governance.


    To calculate the Compound III supply APR as a percentage, divide the current
    utilization by 10 ^ 18 and multiply by the approximate number of seconds in
    one year, then scale up by 100.


    ```solidity

    function getSupplyRate(uint utilization) public view returns (uint64)


    //  utilization: The utilization at which to calculate the rate.

    //  RETURNS: The per second supply rate as the decimal representation of a
    percentage scaled up by 10 ^ 18. E.g. 317100000 indicates, roughly, a 1%
    APR.

    ```


    ### Withdraw (borrow)

    The withdraw method is used to take out collateral that isn't being used to
    support an open borrow. The base asset can be borrowed using the withdraw
    function. The resulting balance must meet the borrowing collateral factor
    requirements.

    The collateral assets that a user adds to their account using the supply
    function increases their borrowing capacity. The percentage of the
    collateral value that can be borrowed is represented by the borrowing
    collateral factor. If an account fails to meet the required borrow
    collateral factor, the user cannot borrow any additional assets until they
    supply more collateral or reduce their borrow balance using the supply
    function.


    ```solidity

    Comet comet = Comet(0xCometAddress);

    comet.withdraw(0xwbtcAddress, 100000000);

    ```


    ### Liquidation

    When an account’s borrow balance exceeds the set liquidation collateral
    limit (which is separate and higher than borrow collateral factor), the
    account is then eligible for liquidation. The latest version of the Compound
    protocol has a different liquidation system than the one before it. In order
    to keep the system running smoothly, the protocol takes in borrower accounts
    that don't meet the collateral requirements.


    If a borrower accrues too much interest on their borrow, or the USD value of
    their collateral reduces, or the USD value of their borrow increases, the
    account becomes liquidatable.


    The protocol price feed allows a liquidator to determine the discounted
    price of seized collateral and sell it publicly. Any account (or liquidator)
    can buy the discounted collateral using the base asset, and the liquidator
    can then buy it back at a higher price on a DEX and pocket the difference.

  shortTitle: COMP Token
  details: >-
    The COMP token is the native token of Compound, it allows users to
    participate in the governance of the Compound protocol. COMP token-holders
    and their delegates debate, propose and vote on all changes to the
    protocol. 


    This system empowers the community to govern the Compound protocol and
    ensures that those who use the protocol have a say in its future. The daily
    distribution of COMP tokens ensures that users are incentivized to
    participate in good governance.


    Each day, approximately 1,234 COMP are distributed to users of the protocol;
    the distribution is allocated to each market (ETH, USDC, DAI…), and is set
    through the governance process by COMP token-holders. COMP accumulates based
    how much is invested by you and everyone else using the protocol. Each time
    you interact with the protocol, supply, borrow, and so on, the COMP you
    accumulated will appear in your wallet.


    Within each market, half of the COMP tokens are earned by suppliers and the
    other half by borrowers. When users use Compound to supply or borrow assets,
    they automatically start accruing COMP. 


    COMP can only be claimed by addresses that interact with the protocol and
    are able to call the claim function.
