  content: What are the mechanisms adopted by Euler to minimize risk that comes with listing multiple assets?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: Euler mitigates risk by using different types of pools which can/cannot be isolated from other assets, they have an asset tier list to employ this feature. They also use risk-adjusted collateral factor. This limits the exposure in case there are any bad debts.

  content: When a user borrows isolation tier asset from an account, that account is locked from further borrowing of any other asset 
  hint: NoHint

  content: Why do we need sub accounts? what is the concept of defer liquidity?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: Once a user borrows an isolation tier asset, that account is locked from borrowing further. It would be cumbersome to create multiple ethereum accounts for each borrow from isolation tier, hence
   sub accounts were introduced where users can create upto 256 subaccounts per ethereum account and manage liabilities in an efficient manner.
   Defer liquidity  is a function where the user can postpone (defer) liquidity checks on the account so that it is checked once after multiple transactions instead of once every transaction.
  answerKeys:
    - A
    - B
    - C
  difficultyLevel: "Medium"
  choices:
    - content: Sub accounts are accounts in Euler that the user can create with the same Ethereum account in order to segregate their liabilites and borrow multiple isolation tier assets from the same Ethereum account
      key: A
      
    - content: Defer liquidity is a concept that allows user to bundle a bunch of transactions and perfom a liquidity check on the user only at the end of the bundle instead of checking after every transaction

  content: Euler lacks a native concept of flash loans
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: Euler lacks a native concept of flash loans. But by making use of the defer liquidity feature, users can make an uncollateralized borrow, perform whatever operation they like, and then repay the borrow - all without being charged extra fees.

  content: Which of the following is true about dTokens and eTokens
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: Euler tokenises debts on the protocol with ERC20-compliant interfaces known as dTokens. Rather than being able to send tokens to anyone but requiring approval to take them, dTokens can be taken by anyone but require approval to accept them. This also prevents users from "burning" their dTokens.
               Lenders who deposit into a liquidity pool on Euler, receive interest-bearing ERC20 eTokens in return, which can be redeemed for their share of the underlying assets in the pool at any time, provided there are unborrowed tokens in the pool. 
  answerKeys:
    - B
    - C
    - D
  difficultyLevel: "High"
  choices:
    - content: eTokens keep track of debt
      key: A
      
    - content: dTokens are ERC20-compliant interfaces,dTokens accrue the debt to be paid by users who have borrowed. They can be transferred to other accounts, but instead of transaction approval from the sender, it needs to be approved by the receiver
      key: B
      
    - content: eTokens are ERC20-compliant interfaces that the users receive on supplying collateral to the protocol. They accrue interest and overtime can be redeemed for a larger amount of underlying tokens. They can be redeemed given the redemption will not make open borrows unsustainable.
      key: C
      
    - content: Burning dTokens would mean that the loan is being repaid

  content: What is minting and burning in Euler?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: Minting is the recursive supplying and borrowing of the same asset as the collateral in order to achieve a leveraged position. Burning is deleting one set of deposit 
   and borrow the multiple sets of deposits and borrows made in minting. Say you have 1000 USDC and you can make a borrow of upto 90% of USDC value, you take a loan of 900 USDC. Now you take the 900 USDC and supply it as collateral. Now with the increased borrowing capacity, you 
   take a loan of 810 USDC and supply it as collateral again. Now in the Euler protocol, you are earning interest on 1710 USDC while you only had 1000 USDC to begin with.
