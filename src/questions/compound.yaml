  content: What are the differences between Compound V2 and Compound III?
  hint: none
  explanation:  In the new version of the protocol, there is a separate market for each
    token. That token acts as the "base token" in that market, only one base token can be set. A supplier can
    lend the base token in the market and can earn interest. No interest will be
    accrued by assets that are supplied as collateral and cTokens are no
    longer used.

  content: When is an account liquidated?
  hint: none
  explanation: When an accountâ€™s borrow balance exceeds the set liquidation collateral
    limit (which is separate and higher than borrow collateral factor), the
    account is then eligible for liquidation. Meaning, when the account balance for the account is negative. 
    If a borrower accrues too much interest on their borrow, or the USD value of
    their collateral reduces, or the USD value of their borrow increases, the
    account becomes liquidatable.

  content: What is the liquidator required to do in a liquidation event? How are they incentivized? 
  hint: NoHint
  explanation:  The protocol price feed allows a liquidator to determine the discounted price of seized collateral and sell it publicly. Any account (or liquidator)
    can buy the discounted collateral using the base asset, and the liquidator can then buy it back at a higher price on a DEX and pocket the difference.
  answerKeys:
    - A

  choices:
    - content: The protocol requires the liquidator to seize collateral and repay the loan like it was their own loan
      key: A
      
    - content: The collateral can be bought at a discounted price by the liquidator using their base token, which can be sold at a higher price for a profit
      key: B
      
    - content: The protocol just requires the liquidator to call the liquidate function, for this, the liquidator is rewarded in base tokens
      key: C
      
    - content: The protocol liquidates bad loans on its own, there is no need for liquidators
      key: D
