      Compound finance is one of the first decentralized finance (DeFi)
      protocols that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. The
      interest rates on the platform are determined by supply and demand, with
      the goal of providing a fair and transparent way for users to earn returns
      on their assets or access capital.
