      In the context of decentralized finance (DeFi), lending and borrowing
      refers to the practice of using smart contracts on blockchain technology
      to facilitate the lending and borrowing of digital assets. These smart
      contracts allow for the automation of the lending and borrowing process,
      enabling users to lend and borrow funds without the need for a traditional
      financial intermediary such as a bank.

    key: compound
    details: >+
      Compound finance is one of the first decentralized finance (DeFi)
      protocols that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. The
      interest rates on the platform are determined by supply and demand, with
      the goal of providing a fair and transparent way for users to earn returns
      on their assets or access capital.

    key: euler
    details: >+
      Euler is a non-custodial DeFi protocol that allows users to lend and borrow and 
      the main factor that differentiates Euler form other trusted protocols like Aave 
      and Compound is that, in Euler any asset that has a WETH pair on Uniswap v3 can be 
      added as a lending market on Euler by anyone straight away.
