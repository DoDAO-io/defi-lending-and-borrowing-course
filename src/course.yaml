      In the context of decentralized finance (DeFi), lending and borrowing
      refers to the practice of using smart contracts on blockchain technology
      to facilitate the lending and borrowing of digital assets. These smart
      contracts allow for the automation of the lending and borrowing process,
      enabling users to lend and borrow funds without the need for a traditional
      financial intermediary such as a bank.

    details: >+
      Compound finance is one of the first decentralized finance (DeFi)
      protocols that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. The
      interest rates on the platform are determined by supply and demand, with
      the goal of providing a fair and transparent way for users to earn returns
      on their assets or access capital.

    details: >+
      Euler is a non-custodial DeFi protocol that allows users to lend and
      borrow and  the main factor that differentiates Euler form other trusted
      protocols like Aave  and Compound is that, in Euler any asset that has a
      WETH pair on Uniswap v3 can be  added as a lending market on Euler by
      anyone straight away.

      Venus is an algorithm based money market system on the BNB blockchain.
      Venus brings the money  market protocol of Compound and the minting
      protocol of MakerDAO together, allowing the user to use  one collateral
      for both the functionalities.
