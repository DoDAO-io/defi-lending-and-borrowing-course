          "details": "The COMP token allows users to participate in the governance of the Compound protocol. COMP token-holders and their delegates debate, propose and vote on all changes to the protocol. \n\nThis system empowers the community to govern the Compound protocol and ensures that those who use the protocol have a say in its future. The daily distribution of COMP tokens ensures that users are incentivized to participate in good governance.\n\nEach day, approximately 1,234 COMP are distributed to users of the protocol; the distribution is allocated to each market (ETH, USDC, DAIâ€¦), and is set through the governance process by COMP token-holders.\n\nWithin each market, half of the COMP tokens are earned by suppliers and the other half by borrowers. When users use Compound to supply or borrow assets, they automatically start accruing COMP. \n\nCOMP can only be claimed by addresses that interact with the protocol and are able to call the claim function.",
