          "shortTitle": "About Compound",
          "details": "### Introduction\n\nCompound is one of the first DeFi platforms in the DeFi space. Like other DeFi lending and borrowing platforms, users in Compound can Lend asserts to earn interest and can also borrow by having a over collateralized position. \n\nCompound recently released their version three of the protocol, also Called \"Compound III\". and it is quite different from V2. Compound III prioritized safely and isolation of the assets above everything. In V3 when you supply collateral, it remains your property. It can never be withdrawn by other users (except during liquidation).\n\nIn the new version of the protocol, there is a separate market for each token. That token acts as the \"base token\" in that market. A supplier can lend the base token in the market and can earn interest. When a borrower wants to borrow that base token from the market, he can deposit one or more of the other tokens listed in the market as collateral. No interest will be accrued by these assets that are supplied as collateral and cTokens are no longer used.\n\nThe major concepts to understand in Compound III are,\n\n### Utilization and Interest Rates\nThe interest rates for supply and borrowing are based on the utilization rate of the base asset. There is a point beyond which the interest rate starts to increase more rapidly, called the \"kink.\" Interest accrues every second, using the block timestamp. Collateral assets do not earn or pay interest.\n\nThis function returns the current protocol utilization of the base asset. The formula for producing the utilization is:\n\n`Utilization = TotalBorrows / TotalSupply`\n\n```solidity\nfunction getUtilization() public view returns (uint)\n\n// RETURNS: The current protocol utilization percentage as a decimal, represented by an unsigned integer, scaled up by 10 ^ 18. E.g. 1e17 or 100000000000000000 is 10% utilization.\n```\n\n### Supply\nThe supply function allows users to add assets to the protocol in order to increase their borrowing capacity. This function can be used to add collateral, supply the base asset, or repay an open borrow of the base asset. Collateral can only be added if the market is below its supplyCap.\n\nCompound III enables users to earn interest on their positive balances of the base asset, based on separate interest rate models that are set by governance.\n\nTo calculate the Compound III supply APR as a percentage, divide the current utilization by 10 ^ 18 and multiply by the approximate number of seconds in one year, then scale up by 100.\n\n```solidity\nfunction getSupplyRate(uint utilization) public view returns (uint64)\n\n//  utilization: The utilization at which to calculate the rate.\n//  RETURNS: The per second supply rate as the decimal representation of a percentage scaled up by 10 ^ 18. E.g. 317100000 indicates, roughly, a 1% APR.\n```\n\n### Withdraw (borrow)\nThe withdraw method is used to take out collateral that isn't being used to support an open borrow. The base asset can be borrowed using the withdraw function. The resulting balance must meet the borrowing collateral factor requirements.\nThe collateral assets that a user adds to their account using the supply function increases their borrowing capacity. The percentage of the collateral value that can be borrowed is represented by the borrowing collateral factor. If an account fails to meet the required borrow collateral factor, the user cannot borrow any additional assets until they supply more collateral or reduce their borrow balance using the supply function.\n\n```solidity\nComet comet = Comet(0xCometAddress);\ncomet.withdraw(0xwbtcAddress, 100000000);\n```\n\n### Liquidation\nWhen an account’s borrow balance exceeds the set liquidation collateral limit (which is separate and higher than borrow collateral factor), the account is then eligible for liquidation. The latest version of the Compound protocol has a different liquidation system than the one before it. In order to keep the system running smoothly, the protocol takes in borrower accounts that don't meet the collateral requirements.\n\nIf a borrower accrues too much interest on their borrow, or the USD value of their collateral reduces, or the USD value of their borrow increases, the account becomes liquidatable.\n\nThe protocol price feed allows a liquidator to determine the discounted price of seized collateral and sell it publicly. Any account (or liquidator) can buy the discounted collateral using the base asset, and the liquidator can then buy it back at a higher price on a DEX and pocket the difference.\n\n"

          "shortTitle": "COMP Token",
          "details": "The COMP token is the native token of Compound, it allows users to participate in the governance of the Compound protocol. COMP token-holders and their delegates debate, propose and vote on all changes to the protocol. \n\nThis system empowers the community to govern the Compound protocol and ensures that those who use the protocol have a say in its future. The daily distribution of COMP tokens ensures that users are incentivized to participate in good governance.\n\nEach day, approximately 1,234 COMP are distributed to users of the protocol; the distribution is allocated to each market (ETH, USDC, DAI…), and is set through the governance process by COMP token-holders. COMP accumulates based how much is invested by you and everyone else using the protocol. Each time you interact with the protocol, supply, borrow, and so on, the COMP you accumulated will appear in your wallet.\n\nWithin each market, half of the COMP tokens are earned by suppliers and the other half by borrowers. When users use Compound to supply or borrow assets, they automatically start accruing COMP. \n\nCOMP can only be claimed by addresses that interact with the protocol and are able to call the claim function."

          "shortTitle": "About Euler",
          "details": "\n### What is Euler \nEuler is a non-custodial DeFi protocol that allows users to lend and borrow and the main factor that differentiates Euler form other trusted protocols like Aave and Compound is that,  in Euler any asset that has a WETH pair on Uniswap v3 can be added as a lending market on Euler by anyone straight away. There is a  significant unmet demand for lending and borrowing  the long tail of crypto assets which are not listed on Aave or Compound. Euler is managed by holders of a protocol native governance token called Euler Governance Token (EUL). \n\n### Asset Tiers\nListing multiple assets which are not necessarily mainstream comes with risk as their price can fluctuate a lot. Euler mitigates this risk by using different types of  pools which can/cannot be isolated from other assets.  This limits the exposure in case there are any bad debts. Another concept adopted by Euler is that they consider the risk factor of both the collateral and the borrowed asset to come up with the maximum amount that can be borrowed for the said collateral-liability asset pair called **risk-adjusted collateral**.   For example, in borrowing XYZ with a collateral factor of 0.5, say you are using $1000 USDC with a collateral factor of 0.9, the maximum amount borrowable would come out ot be 1000*0.5*0.9 = $450 worth of XYZ as opposed to the usual 1000*0.9 that we are used to. \n* Isolation-tier -** ** assets are available for ordinary lending and borrowing, but they cannot be used as collateral to borrow other assets, and they can only be borrowed in isolation. What this means is that they cannot be borrowed alongside other assets using the same pool of collateral.  * Cross-tier -** ** assets are available for ordinary lending and borrowing, and cannot be used as collateral to borrow other assets, but they can be borrowed alongside other assets. For example, if a user has USDC and DAI as collateral, and they want to borrow cross-tier assets ABC and XYZ, then they can do so from a single account on Euler. * Collateral-tier - assets are available for ordinary lending and borrowing, cross-borrowing, and they can be used as collateral. For example, a user can deposit collateral assets DAI and USDC, and use them to borrow collateral assets UNI and LINK, all from a single account.\n\n### Liquidations\nA borrower is considered to be in violation of Euler when the value of their risk-adjusted liabilities exceeds the value of their risk-adjusted collateral. A borrower who has just become in violation still has enough collateral to repay their loan, but is at risk of defaulting on their loan. As a result,  they may be liquidated to limit the potential for them to default. One of the issues with a fixed discount percentage for the liquidators on the collateral of the loan they repaid is that potential liquidators often have to engage in priority gas auctions (PGA) in order to find profitable liquidations, which exposes  the liquidation bonus as MEV (miner extractable value). In Euler they allow the discount to increase depending on how far under water a position is. Now, liquidators are forced to engage into a type of Dutch auction. As the discount gradually goes up, each liquidator must decide if they want to bid for a liquidation at the current discount being offered. Liquidator A might  be able to profit at 4%, but liquidator B might be so at 3.5% because they have a more efficient operation. This process is made more efficient by the TWAP oracles used on the Euler network which allow for a more smooth price movement over time which facilitates the dutch auction, preventing all liquidators from jumping in at once.\n\n### Internal Working\nLenders who deposit into a liquidity pool on Euler, receive interest-bearing ERC20 eTokens in return, which can be redeemed for their share of the underlying assets in the pool at any time, provided there are unborrowed tokens in the pool.  Euler tokenises debts on the protocol with ERC20-compliant interfaces known as dTokens. The dToken interface allows the construction of positions without needing to interact with underlying assets, and can be used to create derivative products that include debt obligations. Euler uses a reversed version of the regular ERC20 transfer/approved methods for dTokens. This means that rather than being able to send tokens to anyone but requiring approval to take them, dTokens can be taken by anyone but require approval to accept them. This also prevents users from \"burning\" their dTokens.\n\n### Other Important Features\nEuler has a lot of innovative features and models that are built on top of the base lending and borrowing layer. These are\n\n#### Minting & Burning and Leverage:\nMinting is the recursive supplying and borrowing of the same asset as the collateral in order to achieve a leveraged position. Eg: Say you have 1000 USDC and you can make a borrow of upto 90% of USDC value, you take a loan of 900 USDC. Now you take the 900 USDC and supply it as collateral. Now with the increased borrowing  capacity, you take a loan of 810 USDC and supply it as collateral again. Now in the Euler protocol, you are earning interest on 1710 USDC while you only had 1000 USDC to begin with, thus increasing your yield. This concept of recursive borrowing and supplying is “Mint” and what it helps the user achieve is called leverage.\nBurning is to delete one set of “borrow” and “deposit”, that is to repay one borrow position and withdraw the respective collateral i.e deleting one set of deposit and borrow the multiple sets of deposits and borrows made. \n\n#### Sub Accounts\nEuler also has a very protocol specific feature called sub-accounts. Once an account is borrowed in an isolated tier, it would be locked from borrowing other assets. In order to not limit the user, Euler enables every Ethereum account to create up-to 256 sub-accounts, allowing the user to segregate their liabilities according to their needs.\n\n#### Transaction Builder\nEuler allows users to bundle a bunch of actions that would otherwise be separate transactions on their own into one by using the transaction builder. This feature ties in with the defer liquidity feature where the liquidity check on the user is done after a bundle of transactions considered as one, whereas usually, a liquidation  check is performed after every action that requires user liquidity (Borrow, withdraw etc). \n\n#### Feeless Flash Loans\nEuler lacks a native concept of flash loans. But by making use of the defer liquidity feature, users can make an uncollateralized borrow, perform whatever operation they like, and then repay the borrow - all without being charged extra fees. This can be used to rebalance positions, build-up leveraged positions, take advantage of external arbitrage opportunities, and more. Because Euler only charges fees according to the time value of money, and from the blockchain's perspective flash loans are held for a duration of 0 seconds, they are entirely free on Euler (ignoring gas costs).\n\n#### Interest Rates\nTo improve capital efficiency and do away with errors in determining parameters for the interest rates of every lending market, Euler uses reactive interest rates. By using a PID controller, Euler amplifies or dampens the rate of change in interest rates when utilization is above or below the target level of utilization respectively. As a result, reactive interest rates  that adapt to market conditions for the underlying asset in real-time are created, without the need for ongoing governance intervention. Interest is accrued every second on Euler.\n\n"

The total supply of EUL is fixed for the first 4 years, after which EUL token holders may enact a governance proposal to inflate the supply by a maximum 2.718% per year.

Burning is deleting one set of deposit and borrow the multiple sets of deposits and borrows made in minting. Say you have 1000 USDC and you can make a borrow of upto 90% of USDC value, you take a loan of 900 USDC. Now you take the 900 USDC and supply it as collateral. Now with the increased borrowing capacity, you take a loan of 810 USDC and supply it as collateral again. Now in the Euler protocol, you are earning interest on 1710 USDC while you only had 1000 USDC to begin with.",

          "details": "\n### What is Venus?\nVenus is an algorithm based money market system on the BNB blockchain. It is a fork of Compound and MakerDAO.\n### Why do we need Venus?\nVenus brings the money market protocol of Compound and the minting protocol of MakerDAO together, allowing the user to use one collateral for both the functionalities. Let us discuss lending and borrowing on Venus. Built on the binance blockchain, Venus has inherent advantages like quick transaction times and low transaction costs. It  combines the features of lending and borrowing along with minting stable coins, making it flexible.  Let us discuss its features in the next sections.\n### Lending and borrowing\nEach asset supported by the Venus Protocol is integrated through a vToken contract, an EIP-20 compliant representation of balances supplied to the protocol.  Every time a user interacts with the Venus protocol, they do so through the vTokens smart contract. By supplying assets to the protocol, users earn an equivalent amount  of vTokens of the underlying asset according to the current exchange rate. The exchange rate depends on the supply rate value of the market entered. This means that the number of  vTokens you hold remains the same while the amount of underlying asset you can redeem using it will keep increasing, hence accumulating interest. Interest is accumulated every block in Venus, similar to Compound.\n\nBy minting vTokens, users  \n* Earn interest through the vToken's exchange rate, which increases in value relative to the underlying asset. \n* Gain the ability to use vTokens as collateral.\n\nLet us now look at the functions offered within the lending and borrowing spectrum in Venus.\n* **Mint/Supply -** The mint function allows a user to transfer an asset into the protocol in order to begin accumulating interest based on the current supply rate. The user then receives a quantity of vTokens, which is equal to the number of underlying tokens supplied divided by the current exchange rate.\n* **Borrow -** The borrow function allows users to take out a loan from the protocol, which starts accruing interest based on the asset's borrowing rate. The amount borrowed can't be more than the user's account liquidity or the market's available liquidity. We'll discuss account liquidity more later.       \n* **Redeem -** The redeem function allows users to convert a specified amount of vTokens into the underlying asset. The amount of underlying tokens received is equal to the number of vTokens redeemed, multiplied by the current exchange rate. To redeem vTokens, the user must have enough liquidity in their account and there must be enough liquidity available in the market. \n* **Repay borrow -** The repay function transfers an asset into the protocol, reducing the user's borrow balance. You can also repay a borrow on behalf of another address using the `repay borrow behalf` function.\n\nLike DAI, Venus has its own stablecoin, VAI. VAI is pegged to the USD. VAI is minted by borrowing it at 50% LTV. That is, $100 worth of assets can be used as collateral to mint a maximum of 50 VAI. Borrowing VAI works exactly similar to normal borrowing we have discussed above in the Venus protocol. This is where Venus derives its functionality from MakerDAO.\n\n### Liquidation                                                                   \n#### **What is account liquidity?** \nAccount Liquidity represents the USD value of assets borrowable by a user, before it reaches liquidation. Users with a shortfall (negative liquidity) are subject to liquidation, and can’t withdraw or borrow assets until Account Liquidity is positive again.\n\n#### **How is it calculated?** \nFor each market the user has entered into, their supplied balance is multiplied by the market’s collateral factor, and summed. Borrow balances (Total amount borrower owes, including interest) are then subtracted, to equal Account Liquidity. Borrowing an asset reduces Account Liquidity for each USD borrowed. Withdrawing an asset reduces Account Liquidity  by the asset’s collateral factor times each USD withdrawn.\n\n#### **What happens when a user has negative account liquidity?** \nA user with negative account liquidity who doesn't have enough collateral to cover their outstanding borrows may be subject to liquidation by other users of the protocol. When a liquidation occurs, a liquidator may repay some or all of an outstanding borrow on behalf of a borrower and in return receive a discounted amount of collateral held by the borrower.  The liquidation incentive is the discount that the liquidator receives. The liquidator first has to seize an asset as collateral as if they are repaying their own borrow, on repaying they receive vTokens with said incentive.\n\n\n",

          "details": "## XVS - Governance Token\n#### XVS  - What is XVS and how is it distributed?                                                                                            \nXVS is the native token of Venus, used in governance. XVS is earned by interacting with the protocol (by borrowing, lending and staking). Let us get into a few details in the next section.                                                                                         How much XVS is distributed to suppliers and borrowers in each market is determined by “venus speed”. This number is updated regularly to ensure that XVS is being distributed proportionally to the amount of utility each market provides.  Any user can call the Unitroller's refreshVenusSpeeds method at any time in order to update the Venus speeds for all markets. The venusRate indicates how much XVS goes to the suppliers or borrowers, so doubling this number shows how much  XVS goes to all suppliers and borrowers combined, meaning equal amount of XVS is emitted to borrowers and suppliers. \n\n#### **How can XVS be claimed?** \nVenus users automatically earn XVS coins for each block they contribute to or borrow from the protocol. The protocol will automatically transfer the accrued XVS to a user's address when the total amount of XVS earned by that address (in a market)  reaches a certain threshold. If the address executes any of the mint, borrow, transfer, liquidateBorrow, repayBorrow, or redeem functions on that market, the user can claim their Venus tokens. Alternatively, users can call the claimVenus method on any  vToken contract at any time for more granular control over which markets to claim from.\n\n#### **Is staking/vault mechanism available on Venus? Can XVS be earned in any other way?** \nVenus Vault is a mechanism that locks XVS to improve the system’s anti-risk ability and distributes staking rewards. Apart from lending and borrowing to earn XVS, XVS can be staked/ held in Venus vaults to earn it as interest, the rewards are part of  the daily XVS output. It is important to note that XVS is the governance token of the Venus protocol and only staked XVS is eligible to be used as vote in the governance of Venus. Holding XVS in the vault gives you voting power, which you can delegate if  you choose to. Will enable you to obtain income distribution from the Venus protocol. The XVS deposited in the vault will have a 7 day period which you have to wait out till you can redeem your XVS, the XVS deposited in vaults cannot be used as collateral for borrowing.                                                                                                                             The Vault has multiple functions such as risk guarantee, voting governance, income distribution and rewards distribution, ensuring that the XVS holders’ benefits and responsibilities are equal.                                                                                                              \n\n#### **How does vaults help Venus in case of risk events?**\nAfter a risk event occurs in Venus and only if the Venus risk fund account is not sufficient to cover the shortfall, the XVS depositor in the vault will pay a maximum of 10% of the total deposit amount to compensate for the loss.\n\n## VRT                                                                                                                                         \nApart from XVS, there is VRT (Venus Reward Token) which was created in order to distribute the liquidity mining distribution among borrowers. VRT can be deposited in the VRT vault to earn rewards. In addition to that there is also provision for the user to exchange between  VRT and XVS at the rate of 12000 VRT = 1 XVS. Currently, VRT can be earned as interest in vaults. Only use case for VRT in the Venus protocol currently is to redeem it for XVS at the rate mentioned above. VRT can also be deposited in the VRT vault to obtain rewards. These two  functions will be available for a period of 12 months, after which VRT will no longer play a role in the Venus ecosystem.\n   \n ",
