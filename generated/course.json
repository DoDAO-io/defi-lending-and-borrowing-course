          "shortTitle": "About Compound",
          "details": "### Introduction\n\nCompound is one of the first DeFi platforms in the DeFi space. Like other DeFi lending and borrowing platforms, users in Compound can Lend asserts to earn interest and can also borrow by having a over collateralized position. \n\nCompound recently released their version three of the protocol, also Called \"Compound III\". and it is quite different from V2. Compound III prioritized safely and isolation of the assets above everything. In V3 when you supply collateral, it remains your property. It can never be withdrawn by other users (except during liquidation).\n\nIn the new version of the protocol, there is a separate market for each token. That token acts as the \"base token\" in that market. A supplier can lend the base token in the market and can earn interest. When a borrower wants to borrow that base token from the market, he can deposit one or more of the other tokens listed in the market as collateral. No interest will be accrued by these assets that are supplied as collateral and cTokens are no longer used.\n\nThe major concepts to understand in Compound III are,\n\n### Utilization and Interest Rates\nThe interest rates for supply and borrowing are based on the utilization rate of the base asset. There is a point beyond which the interest rate starts to increase more rapidly, called the \"kink.\" Interest accrues every second, using the block timestamp. Collateral assets do not earn or pay interest.\n\nThis function returns the current protocol utilization of the base asset. The formula for producing the utilization is:\n\n`Utilization = TotalBorrows / TotalSupply`\n\n```solidity\nfunction getUtilization() public view returns (uint)\n\n// RETURNS: The current protocol utilization percentage as a decimal, represented by an unsigned integer, scaled up by 10 ^ 18. E.g. 1e17 or 100000000000000000 is 10% utilization.\n```\n\n### Supply\nThe supply function allows users to add assets to the protocol in order to increase their borrowing capacity. This function can be used to add collateral, supply the base asset, or repay an open borrow of the base asset. Collateral can only be added if the market is below its supplyCap.\n\nCompound III enables users to earn interest on their positive balances of the base asset, based on separate interest rate models that are set by governance.\n\nTo calculate the Compound III supply APR as a percentage, divide the current utilization by 10 ^ 18 and multiply by the approximate number of seconds in one year, then scale up by 100.\n\n```solidity\nfunction getSupplyRate(uint utilization) public view returns (uint64)\n\n//  utilization: The utilization at which to calculate the rate.\n//  RETURNS: The per second supply rate as the decimal representation of a percentage scaled up by 10 ^ 18. E.g. 317100000 indicates, roughly, a 1% APR.\n```\n\n### Withdraw (borrow)\nThe withdraw method is used to take out collateral that isn't being used to support an open borrow. The base asset can be borrowed using the withdraw function. The resulting balance must meet the borrowing collateral factor requirements.\nThe collateral assets that a user adds to their account using the supply function increases their borrowing capacity. The percentage of the collateral value that can be borrowed is represented by the borrowing collateral factor. If an account fails to meet the required borrow collateral factor, the user cannot borrow any additional assets until they supply more collateral or reduce their borrow balance using the supply function.\n\n```solidity\nComet comet = Comet(0xCometAddress);\ncomet.withdraw(0xwbtcAddress, 100000000);\n```\n\n### Liquidation\nWhen an account’s borrow balance exceeds the set liquidation collateral limit (which is separate and higher than borrow collateral factor), the account is then eligible for liquidation. The latest version of the Compound protocol has a different liquidation system than the one before it. In order to keep the system running smoothly, the protocol takes in borrower accounts that don't meet the collateral requirements.\n\nIf a borrower accrues too much interest on their borrow, or the USD value of their collateral reduces, or the USD value of their borrow increases, the account becomes liquidatable.\n\nThe protocol price feed allows a liquidator to determine the discounted price of seized collateral and sell it publicly. Any account (or liquidator) can buy the discounted collateral using the base asset, and the liquidator can then buy it back at a higher price on a DEX and pocket the difference.\n\n"

          "details": "The COMP token is the native token of Compound, it allows users to participate in the governance of the Compound protocol. COMP token-holders and their delegates debate, propose and vote on all changes to the protocol. \n\nThis system empowers the community to govern the Compound protocol and ensures that those who use the protocol have a say in its future. The daily distribution of COMP tokens ensures that users are incentivized to participate in good governance.\n\nEach day, approximately 1,234 COMP are distributed to users of the protocol; the distribution is allocated to each market (ETH, USDC, DAI…), and is set through the governance process by COMP token-holders. COMP accumulates based how much is invested by you and everyone else using the protocol. Each time you interact with the protocol, supply, borrow, and so on, the COMP you accumulated will appear in your wallet.\n\nWithin each market, half of the COMP tokens are earned by suppliers and the other half by borrowers. When users use Compound to supply or borrow assets, they automatically start accruing COMP. \n\nCOMP can only be claimed by addresses that interact with the protocol and are able to call the claim function."

          "details": "\n### What is Euler \nEuler is a non-custodial DeFi protocol that allows users to lend and borrow. What sets Euler apart from other trusted protocols like Aave and Compound is that anyone can add any asset that has a WETH pair on Uniswap v3 as a lending market on Euler straight away. There is significant unmet demand for lending and borrowing the long tail of crypto assets which are not listed on Aave or Compound, and Euler provides users with the opportunity to list these assets. This makes it possible to tap into a whole new world of potential earning opportunities. Euler is managed by holders  of the protocol native governance token called Euler Governance Token (EUL). \n\n### Asset Tiers\nListing multiple assets which are not necessarily mainstream comes with risk as their price can fluctuate a lot. Euler mitigates this risk by using different types of  pools which can/cannot be isolated from other assets.  This limits the exposure in case there are any bad debts. \n* **Isolation-tier -** assets are available for ordinary lending and borrowing, but they cannot be used as collateral to borrow other assets, and they can only be borrowed in isolation. What this means is that they cannot be borrowed alongside other assets using the same pool of collateral. \n* **Cross-tier -**  assets are available for ordinary lending and borrowing, and cannot be used as collateral to borrow other assets, but they can be borrowed alongside other assets. For example, if a user has USDC and DAI as collateral, and they want to borrow cross-tier assets ABC and XYZ, then they can do so from a single account on Euler.\n* **Collateral-tier -** assets are available for ordinary lending and borrowing, cross-borrowing, and they can be used as collateral. For example, a user can deposit collateral assets DAI and USDC, and use them to borrow collateral assets UNI and LINK, all from a single account.\n\n### Risk adjusted collateral \nAnother concept adopted by Euler is that they consider the risk factor of both the collateral and the borrowed asset to come up with the maximum amount that can be borrowed for the said collateral-liability asset pair called **risk-adjusted collateral**.   \n\nFor example, in borrowing XYZ with a collateral factor of 0.5, say you are using $1000 USDC with a collateral factor of 0.9, the maximum amount borrowable would come out to be \n\n`1000 * 0.5 * 0.9 = $450 worth of XYZ`\n\n as opposed to the usual `1000 * 0.9` that we are used to. \n\n### Liquidations\nA borrower is considered to be in violation of Euler when the value of their risk-adjusted liabilities exceeds the value of their risk-adjusted collateral. A borrower who has just become in violation still has enough collateral to repay their loan, but is at risk of defaulting on their loan. As a result,  they may be liquidated to limit the potential for them to default. One of the issues with a fixed discount percentage for the liquidators on the collateral of the loan they repaid is that potential liquidators often have to engage in priority gas auctions (PGA) in order to find profitable liquidations, which exposes the liquidation bonus as MEV (miner extractable value).  \n\nIn Euler they allow the discount to increase depending on how far underwater a position is. Now, liquidators are forced to engage in a type of Dutch auction. As the discount gradually goes up, each liquidator must decide if they want to bid for liquidation at the current discount being offered. For example, liquidator  A might be able to profit at 4%, but liquidator B might be so at 3.5% because they have a more efficient operation. This process is made more efficient by the TWAP oracles used on the Euler network which allow for a more smooth price movement over time and facilitates the dutch auction, preventing all liquidators from jumping in at once.\n\n### Internal Working\nLenders who deposit into a liquidity pool on Euler, receive interest-bearing ERC20 eTokens in return, which can be redeemed for their share of the underlying assets in the pool at any time, provided there are unborrowed tokens in the pool.  Euler tokenizes debts on the protocol with ERC20-compliant interfaces known as dTokens. The dToken interface allows the construction of positions without needing to interact with underlying assets, and can be used to create derivative products that include debt obligations. Euler uses a reversed version of the regular ERC20 transfer/approved methods for dTokens. This means that rather than being able to send tokens to anyone but requiring approval to take them, dTokens can be taken by anyone but require approval to accept them. This also prevents users from \"burning\" their dTokens.\n\n### Other Important Features\nEuler has a lot of innovative features and models that are built on top of the base lending and borrowing layer. These are\n\n**Minting & Burning and Leverage -**\nMinting is the recursive supplying and borrowing of the same asset as the collateral in order to achieve a leveraged position. Eg: Say you have 1000 USDC and you can make a borrow of up to 90% of USDC value, you take a loan of 900 USDC. Now you take the 900 USDC and supply it as collateral. Now with the increased borrowing capacity, you take a loan of 810 USDC and supply it as collateral again. Now in the Euler protocol, you are earning interest on 1710 USDC while you only had 1000 USDC to begin with, thus increasing your yield. This concept of recursive borrowing and supplying is “Mint” and what it helps the user achieve is called leverage.\nBurning is to delete one set of “borrow” and “deposit”, that is to repay one borrow position and withdraw the respective collateral i.e deleting one set of deposit and borrow the multiple sets of deposits and borrows made. \n\n**Sub Accounts -**\nEuler also has a very protocol-specific feature called sub-accounts. Once an account is borrowed in an isolated tier, it would be locked from borrowing other assets. In order to not limit the user, Euler enables every Ethereum account to create up-to 256 sub-accounts, allowing the user to segregate their liabilities according to their needs.\n\n**Transaction Builder -**\nEuler allows users to bundle a bunch of actions that would otherwise be separate transactions on their own into one by using the transaction builder. This feature ties in with the defer liquidity feature where the liquidity check on the user is done after a bundle of transactions considered as one, whereas usually, a liquidation  check is performed after every action that requires user liquidity (Borrow, withdraw etc). \n\n**Feeless Flash Loans -**\nEuler lacks a native concept of flash loans. But by making use of the defer liquidity feature, users can make an uncollateralized borrow, perform whatever operation they like, and then repay the borrow - all without being charged extra fees. This can be used to rebalance positions, build-up leveraged positions, take advantage of external arbitrage opportunities, and more. Because Euler only charges fees according to the time value of money, and from the blockchain's perspective flash loans are held for a duration of 0 seconds, they are entirely free on Euler (ignoring gas costs).\n\n**Interest Rates -**\nTo improve capital efficiency and do away with errors in determining parameters for the interest rates of every lending market, Euler uses reactive interest rates. By using a PID controller, Euler amplifies or dampens the rate of change in interest rates when utilization is above or below the target level of utilization respectively. As a result, reactive interest rates  that adapt to market conditions for the underlying asset in real-time are created, without the need for ongoing governance intervention. Interest is accrued every second on Euler.\n\n"

          "details": "\n### What is Venus?\nVenus is an algorithm based money market system on the BNB blockchain. It is a fork of Compound and MakerDAO.\n### Why do we need Venus?\nVenus is a powerful lending and borrowing, and stablecoin minting protocol that combines the features of Compound and MakerDAO, allowing users to utilize one collateral for both functionalities.  Built on the binance blockchain, Venus has inherent advantages like quick transaction times and low transaction costs. It provides flexiblity to the user, combining the features of lending and borrowing with minting stablecoins.  In the next section, we will discuss its features in more detail.\n### Lending and borrowing\n**vTokens** <br>\nEach asset supported by the Venus Protocol is integrated through a vToken contract, an EIP-20 compliant representation of balances supplied to the protocol. \nEvery time a user interacts with the Venus protocol, they do so through the vTokens smart contract. By supplying assets to the protocol, users earn an equivalent amount  of vTokens of the underlying asset according to the current exchange rate. The exchange rate depends on the supply rate value of the market entered. This means that the number of  vTokens you hold remains the same while the amount of underlying asset you can redeem using it will keep increasing, hence accumulating interest. Interest is accumulated every block in Venus, similar to Compound.\nBy minting vTokens, users  * Earn interest through the vToken's exchange rate, which increases in value relative to the underlying asset. * Gain the ability to use vTokens as collateral.\nLet us now look at the functions offered within the lending and borrowing spectrum in Venus.\n* **Mint/Supply -** The mint function allows a user to transfer an asset into the protocol in order to begin accumulating interest based on the current supply rate. The user then receives a quantity of vTokens, which is equal to the number of underlying tokens supplied divided by the current exchange rate.\n* **Borrow -** The borrow function allows users to take out a loan from the protocol, which starts accruing interest based on the asset's borrowing rate. The amount borrowed can't be more than the user's account liquidity or the market's available liquidity. We'll discuss account liquidity more later.              \n* **Redeem -** The redeem function allows users to convert a specified amount of vTokens into the underlying asset. The amount of underlying tokens received is equal to the number of vTokens redeemed, multiplied by the current exchange rate. To redeem vTokens, the user must have enough liquidity in their account and there must be enough liquidity available in the market. \n* **Repay borrow -** The repay function transfers an asset into the protocol, reducing the user's borrow balance. You can also repay a borrow on behalf of another address using the `repay borrow behalf` function.\n### VAI\nLike DAI, Venus has its own stablecoin, VAI. VAI is pegged to the USD. VAI is minted by borrowing it at 50% LTV. That is, $100 worth of assets can be used as collateral to mint a maximum of 50 VAI. Borrowing VAI works exactly similar to normal borrowing we have discussed above in the Venus protocol. This is where Venus derives its functionality from MakerDAO.\n### Markets\nEach token listed on Venus has its own market where it can be supplied and borrowed. Each market in Venus has its own distrubution rate for XVS, and supply and borrow rates for the given asset.  It is not mandatory that all markets provide a supply and borrow rate. For example, currently the XVS market in Venus does not provide any rewards for supplying or borrowing. Enter and Exit markets are commonly used terms when it comes to a market.\n\n**Enter Market -** In order to supply collateral or borrow in a market, it must be entered first. \n\n**Exit Market -** Exited markets will not count towards account liquidity calculations. To exit would mean that the user has no more open borrows/ debt in the market and the user is not supplying to the market.\n\n### Liquidation                                                                   \n**Account liquidity** <br> Account Liquidity represents the USD value of assets borrowable by a user, before it reaches liquidation. Users with a shortfall (negative liquidity) are subject to liquidation, and can’t withdraw or borrow assets until Account Liquidity is positive again. <br><br> **How is it calculated?** <br> For each market the user has entered into, their supplied balance is multiplied by the market’s collateral factor, and summed. Borrow balances (Total amount borrower owes, including interest) are then subtracted, to equal Account Liquidity. Borrowing an asset reduces Account Liquidity for each USD borrowed. Withdrawing an asset reduces Account Liquidity  by the asset’s collateral factor times each USD withdrawn. <br><br> **Liquidation event** <br> A user with negative account liquidity who doesn't have enough collateral to cover their outstanding borrows may be subject to liquidation by other users of the protocol. When a liquidation occurs, a liquidator may repay some or all of an outstanding borrow on behalf of a borrower and in return receive a discounted amount of collateral held by the borrower.  The liquidation incentive is the discount that the liquidator receives. The liquidator first has to seize an asset as collateral as if they are repaying their own borrow, on repaying they receive vTokens with said incentive.\n\n\n"

XVS is earned by interacting with the protocol (by borrowing, lending and staking), for each block that the user is actively supplying to, borrowing from, or staking in the protocol, the user accumulates XVS.                                                                                      How much XVS is distributed to suppliers and borrowers in each market is determined by “venus speed”. This number is updated regularly to ensure that XVS is being distributed proportionally to the amount of utility each market provides.  The venus speed is updated automatically each time a user interacts with the protocol.\n**Venus rate**\nIt is an integer that indicates the rate at which the protocol distributes XVS to markets’ suppliers or borrowers, every BSC block. The value is the amount of XVS (in wei), per block, per given market.\n\nVenus speed is determined by,\n\n` utility = vTokenTotalBorrows * assetPrice `\n\n` utilityFraction = utility / sumOfAllVenusedMarketUtilities `\n\n` marketVenusSpeed = venusRate * utilityFraction `\n\n\n<br><br> **Claiming XVS**\n  <br>\nVenus users automatically earn XVS coins for each block they contribute to or borrow from the protocol. The protocol will automatically transfer the accrued XVS to a user's address when the total amount of XVS earned by that address (in a market)  reaches a certain threshold. If the address executes any of the mint, borrow, transfer, liquidateBorrow, repayBorrow, or redeem functions on that market, the user can claim their Venus tokens. Alternatively, users can call the claimVenus method on any  vToken contract at any time for more granular control over which markets to claim from.\n<br><br>\n### VRT   \nApart from XVS, there is VRT (Venus Reward Token) which was created in order to distribute the liquidity mining distribution among borrowers. VRT can be deposited in the VRT vault to earn rewards. In addition to that there is also provision for the user to exchange between  VRT and XVS at the rate of 12000 VRT = 1 XVS. Currently, VRT can be earned as interest in vaults. Only use case for VRT in the Venus protocol currently is to redeem it for XVS at the rate mentioned above. VRT can also be deposited in the VRT vault to obtain rewards. These two  functions will be available for a period of 12 months, after which VRT will no longer play a role in the Venus ecosystem.\n<br><br>\n### Venus Vaults\nVenus Vault is a mechanism that locks XVS to improve the system’s anti-risk ability and distributes staking rewards. Apart from lending and borrowing to earn XVS, XVS can be staked/ held in Venus vaults to earn it as interest, the rewards are part of  the daily XVS output. It is important to note that XVS is the governance token of the Venus protocol and only staked XVS is eligible to be used as vote in the governance of Venus. Holding XVS in the vault gives you voting power, which you can delegate if  you choose to. Will enable you to obtain income distribution from the Venus protocol. The XVS deposited in the vault will have a 7 day period which you have to wait out till you can redeem your XVS, the XVS deposited in vaults cannot be used as collateral for borrowing.                                                            The Vault has multiple functions such as risk guarantee, voting governance, income distribution and rewards distribution, ensuring that the XVS holders’ benefits and responsibilities are equal.     <br> Venus offers vaults that support VRT, VAI and XVS. By holding VAI and XVS in vaults, the user gets incentivized by XVS. In the VRT vault however, the user get incentivized with VRT itself whose only usecase in the Venus protocol is to use it to redeem XVS.  So it is safe to say that all the vaults supported by Venus incentivize the user ultimately in XVS.\n\n**Vaults in case of risk events**  <br>   After a risk event occurs in Venus and only if the Venus risk fund account is not sufficient to cover the shortfall, the XVS depositor in the vault will pay a maximum of 10% of the total deposit amount to compensate for the loss.\n\n   \n "

          "details": "### Aave\nAave is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity market protocol that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can earn a passive income by providing liquidity to the market, or by borrowing in an overcollateralized fashion. Aave has its own governance system, and AAVE is the governance token that gives holders voting rights. We will look into depth about the working of lending and borrowing in Aave V3 in the coming sections.\n### Lending and Borrowing\nLet us first talk about Lending in Aave. Aave is a protocol where users can supply their assets to the protocol and earn interest on the supplied asset. The interest rate provided by Aave for supplying an asset to the protocol depends on the utilization rate of that asset / market (total borrows / total supplies). The interest accumulated on the supplied asset is calculated using aTokens.\n\n**How are aTokens minted?**\n\naTokens are tokens that are minted and burnt every time there is a `supply` or `withdraw` of assets to an Aave market. These tokens signify the amount of crypto assets that have been supplied and the yield earned on those supplied assets. The value of an aToken is pegged to the value of the corresponding asset at a 1:1 ratio, which means it can be stored, transferred or traded safely.\n\n**How is interest accrued?**\n\nAt the time of supply, the user receives an equivalent amount of aTokens for the given asset. The exchange rate of the aTokens to the underlying asset remains 1:1, but the amount of aToken in the user's wallet increases over time. This allows the user to redeem a larger amount of the underlying asset over time, thus accruing interest.\n\n \n\naTokens can be transferred to other accounts as long as the transfer does not put the user in a position where they do not have enough underlying collateral in their possession to maintain the health factor of an open borrow above 1.           \n\nLet us now look at borrowing in Aave. Assets are borrowed in Aave by overcollateralization. The maximum amount a user can borrow is based on the collateral factor of the assets supplied as collateral. Users can choose to borrow at a stable or variable rate. The variable rate is often lower than the stable rate but bound to change, the stable rate is fixed. Borrowers can pick and choose which rate they prefer. If they change their mind or find the other rate of interest to be more profitable, users can switch from one form of interest to another. The debt accrued by the user is accounted for by debt tokenization instead of calculation in a smart contract. \n\n**What are debt tokens? How are they minted?**\n\nDebt tokens are interest-accruing tokens that are minted and burned on borrow and repay, representing the debt owed by the token holder. \n\nThere are 2 types of debt tokens:\n\n\n* Stable debt tokens, representing a debt with a stable interest rate\n* Variable debt tokens, representing a debt with a variable interest rate\n\n**Supply and borrow caps**\n* **Supply caps -** Limiting how much of a certain asset is supplied to the Aave protocol. This helps in reducing exposure to a certain asset and mitigate attacks like infinite minting or price oracle manipulation.\n* **Borrow caps -** Modulation of how much of each asset can be borrowed, which reduces insolvency risk.\n\n### Other features related to Lending and borrowing in Aave\n\n**Flash loans**\n\nA Flash Loan is a type of loan where you can borrow any amount of assets that are available without putting up any collateral, as long as the liquidity is returned to the protocol within the timeframe of one single block transaction. In order to take out a Flash Loan, you will need to create a contract that requests a loan. The contract will then need to execute the instructed steps and pay back the loan plus interest and fees all (including gas fees) within the same transaction.\n\n\n**Collateral trading / swapping**\n\nBuilt by using Flash Loans v2, this feature allows the user to swap their existing collateral for an equivalent amount of collateral in another asset.  For example, a user has 80MKR  and 20 SNX deposited in the protocol, with a debt of 50 USDC. He wants to swap both his deposited MKR and SNX to AAVE, without needing to pay back any debt within one transaction. This can be done using collateral trading / swapping.\n\n**Repay with collateral**\n\nAlso built by using Flash Loans v2, this feature allows for an user to use their collateral (any asset they supplied that is enabled as collateral) to be used to repay their borrow position partially or completely in a single transaction.\n\n**Credit delegation**\n\nThe credit delegation function allows users to deposit funds into the protocol in order to earn interest, and delegate borrowing power to other users. The terms of the loan and its enforcement are agreed upon between the depositor and borrowers, which can be done either off-chain or on-chain. Users can open credit lines to different addresses using the borrow function, other addresses can borrow from the user without the need for collateral, as long as the caller address has been granted the allowance by the user / supplier. This functionality is implemented by a function called approveDelegation which allows the user to approve another address to make borrows on behalf of the user.\n\n**Repay with atokens** \n\nAllows the user to repay with aTokens in case the underlying borrowed asset is locked in the Aave liquidity pool. This feature can only be done when the user holds atokens of the same asset that they have borrowed.  For example, User has USDC debt and also holds aUSDC token. The user in this case can use aUSDC to repay USDC debt in single transaction without any approvals or having to withdraw their supplied liquidity to the pool using repayWithATokens. The borrow of USDC can only be repaid by aUSDC in this feature. It cannot be repaid with another token, like aDAI.\n\n**Siloed borrowing**\n\nThe Aave protocol allows for the listing of assets with potentially manipulatable oracles as single borrow assets. If a user borrows a siloed asset, they will not be able to borrow any other assets, ensuring that the risks are contained. This helps to mitigate the risk associated with such assets and helps prevent them from impacting the overall solvency of the protocol.\n\n#### **How can a user enter a siloed borrowing state?**\n\nUsers automatically enter a siloed borrowing state on their first successful borrow of a siloed asset.\n\n#### **How does a user exit a siloed borrowing state?**\n\nUser must repay all their debt to exit the state\n\n\n**Isolation mode**                    \n\nIsolation mode on Aave lets you list new assets as Isolated with a designated debt ceiling. This is useful for borrowing stablecoins that have been approved by Aave Governance to be borrowed in isolation mode. When using an Isolated Asset as collateral, borrowers are restricted to only using that particular asset as collateral and can only borrow assets that are borrowable in isolation mode. If users need to, they can turn off isolation mode by disabling the isolated asset as collateral. The only time this isn't possible is when the user has outstanding debt.\n\n**E-Mode**\n\nEnabling E-Mode restricts borrowers into borrowing only from assets belonging to a certain category. For example, stablecoin. When E-mode is enabled and the user supplies collateral of the same category as the E-mode asset, the user is given more capital efficiency. That is, the user is allowed a higher LTV on his collateral and the liquidation threshold is changed to provide better capital efficiency when they supply assets that are in the same category as the E-Mode asset they borrowed. This means that the user can borrow more by enabling E-Mode, given conditions mentioned above are met.\n    \n\n### Liquidations\n\nA liquidation is a process that occurs when a borrower's health factor goes below 1 due to their collateral value not properly covering their loan/debt value. This might happen when the collateral decreases in value or the borrowed debt increases in value against each other. This collateral vs borrow balance value ratio is shown in the health factor. In collateral we consider all assets that the user has supplied to the protocol which are enabled to be used as collateral. Borrow balance includes the amount borrowed by the user along with the interest they must pay. Liquidators can liquidate a part of (< 100% of borrowed amount) or the whole borrow (100% of borrowed amount) depending on whether the HF is above or below the close factor HF threshold respectively and get incentivized by being able to buy the seized collateral at a discounted rate.\n \n\nIn order to avoid liquidations, the borrower must maintain a good health factor (HF>1). This can be done in two ways,\n\n* Increase the collateral supplied\n* Repay the borrowed amount\n \n\nAs for liquidators, more often than not, only the liquidator with the most efficient solutions and bots who find the bad loan first will get the liquidation bonus. There are 2 ways of participating in a liquidation,\n\n* By calling the liquidationCall() directly in the Pool contract.\n* By creating your own automated bot or system to liquidate loans.\n\nThe liquidator has the option to receive their liquidation incentive in the form of the underlying asset or an aToken. This system is beneficial for liquidators as they are rewarded with liquidation incentives, motivating more liquidators to get rid of bad loans. This acts as an incentive to ensure that lenders are provided with protection against loan defaults and bad loans. Liquidations are especially useful during bearish markets when viewed from the lender's perspective. The liquidation bonuses for all assets are evaluated and determined based on each asset's liquidity risk and updated through the Aave Governance process.\n\n\n"

          "details": "\n### AAVE\n\nThe AAVE token is the native currency of the Aave platform. There is a maximum supply of 16 million AAVE tokens. AAVE token is what gives user voting power in Aave governance, it can be delegated to other users. The primary use of AAVE tokens is for governance; this means that users can vote and decide on the outcomes of platform improvement proposals (AIPs). Additionally, the token offers several advantages to users, token holders will be able to stake their tokens to provide liquidity to the Aave protocol and earn staking rewards.\n \n \n**DelegationAwareAToken**                        \n\nThe special type of aToken that are minted and burned upon supply and withdraw of assets that has voting power associated (which can be delegated) with them. These aTokens are enabled to delegate voting power of the underlying asset to a different address.\n\n**Aave safety module**\n\nThe Aave Protocol is secured by AAVE holders locking their tokens into the Safety Module (SM). The SM is a Smart Contract-based component that will be used to mitigate Shortfall Events within the money markets that belong to the Aave ecosystem. A Shortfall Event occurs when there is a deficit of liquidity for the liquidity providers, which will be interpreted by Protocol Governance (detailed in Governance) and subject to voting. If a Shortfall Event occurs, part of the locked AAVE is auctioned on the market to help raise funds to cover the deficit. The SM has mechanisms in place that would not allow a sudden surge of AAVE into the market, which would further reduce the value of AAVE. Participants who lock their AAVE into the SM do so knowing that there is a chance of a Shortfall Event occurring, but they are rewarded with Safety Incentives (SI). \n \n\nThe Aave protocol allows users to stake their AAVE tokens in the Safety Module in order to receive rewards in return. These rewards can be claimed at any time. Users can withdraw their staked AAVE (unstake) by activating a cool-down period, which is currently 7 days. The protocol rewards 550 new AAVE tokens per day, to be split between the stakers in proportion to how much they have staked.\n \n\nThe Aave Protocol V3 now supports multiple rewards per token, which means that it's possible for an asset listing to enable additional incentive rewards denominated in the underlying tokens. This is a great improvement over the previous version, which only allowed rewards to be denominated in stkAAVE. V3 also allows users to claim rewards to another account, as well as themselves, and to claim multiple types of rewards per asset in a single transaction.\n\n \n "
