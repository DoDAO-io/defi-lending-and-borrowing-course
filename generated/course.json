          "details": "### Introduction\n\nCompound is one of the first DeFi platforms in the DeFi space. Like other DeFi lending and borrowing platforms, users in Compound can Lend asserts to earn interest and can also borrow by having a over collateralized position. \n\nCompound recently released their version three of the protocol, also Called \"Compound III\". and it is quite different from V2. Compound III prioritized safely and isolation of the assets above everything. In V3 when you supply collateral, it remains your property. It can never be withdrawn by other users (except during liquidation)\n\nIn the new version of the protocol, there is a separate market for each token. That token acts as the \"base token\" in that market. A supplier can lend the base token in the market and can earn interest. When a borrower wants to borrow that base token from the market, he can deposit one or more of the other tokens listed in the market as collateral. No interest will be accrued by these assets that are supplied as collateral.\n\n### Utilization and Interest Rates\nThe interest rates for supply and borrowing are based on the utilization rate of the base asset. There is a point beyond which the interest rate starts to increase more rapidly, called the \"kink.\" Interest accrues every second, using the block timestamp. Collateral assets do not earn or pay interest.\n\n### Supply\nCompound III enables users to earn interest on their positive balances of the base asset, based on separate interest rate models that are set by governance.\n\nTo calculate the Compound III supply APR as a percentage, divide the current utilization by 10 ^ 18 and multiply by the approximate number of seconds in one year, then scale up by 100.\n\n```solidity\n   function getSupplyRate(uint utilization) public view returns (uint64)\n\n   utilization: The utilization at which to calculate the rate.\n   RETURNS: The per second supply rate as the decimal representation of a percentage scaled up by 10 ^ 18. E.g. 317100000 indicates, roughly, a 1% APR.\n```\n",

          "shortTitle": "COMP Token",
          "details": "The COMP token allows users to participate in the governance of the Compound protocol. COMP token-holders and their delegates debate, propose and vote on all changes to the protocol. \n\nThis system empowers the community to govern the Compound protocol and ensures that those who use the protocol have a say in its future. The daily distribution of COMP tokens ensures that users are incentivized to participate in good governance.\n\nEach day, approximately 1,234 COMP are distributed to users of the protocol; the distribution is allocated to each market (ETH, USDC, DAIâ€¦), and is set through the governance process by COMP token-holders.\n\nWithin each market, half of the COMP tokens are earned by suppliers and the other half by borrowers. When users use Compound to supply or borrow assets, they automatically start accruing COMP. \n\nCOMP can only be claimed by addresses that interact with the protocol and are able to call the claim function.",
