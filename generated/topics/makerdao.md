## MakerDAO
 
MakerDAO is a decentralized finance protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling users to generate DAI stablecoin  in a decentralized fashion. The Maker Protocol uses a two-token system, with the first being Dai - a collateral-backed  stablecoin pegged to the USD. The second is MKR, a governance token that is used by stakeholders to keep the system running  and manage Dai.
