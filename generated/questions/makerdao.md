##### What is dust in MakerDAO?  

- [x]  Minimum amount of DAI that must be borrowed to open a vault with the given collateral asset
- [ ]  The fees paid by user to stabilize the protocol

##### What are the use cases of DSR (Dai Savings Rate)?  

- [x]  Users can earn interest on deposited DAI

- [x]  By increasing or decreasing the returns on DAI invested, the protocol can increase or decrease the demand (value) of DAI

##### What is the difference between DAI and SAI?  

- [ ]  SAI can be borrowed using multiple kinds of collateral whereas DAI only accepted ETH as collateral

##### What is done to maintain the peg of DAI?  

- [ ]  DAI is only borrowable using the USD fiat currency
- [x]  Surplus DAI is auctioned off in exchange for MKR to decrease DAI supply
- [x]  Collateral Auctions are used to recover the debt in liquidated Vaults
- [x]  Maker auctions off MKR for a fixed amount of DAI which could increase DAI demand
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: The protocol uses Surplus auctions, Collateral auctions and Debt auctions to increase / decrease the supply of DAI which could be used to regulate its peg to the USD.

- [ ]  Liquidations are no longer incentivized
